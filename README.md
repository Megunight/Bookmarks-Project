# Bookmarks

## bookmarking/bookshelf management system

I wanted to create a program that allows me to:
- track what books/novels I'm currently reading
- what page I'm on
- give me statistics on the book like how many pages left, how long left to read
- allows me to sort the books based on tags (genres) and ratings

I read a lot of webnovels, but I constantly pause in the middle of one to start reading a new one. I also always
between my phone and laptop to read, so it becomes annoying real quick to try and track all the novels, resulting
in lots of tabs open at once. I want a centralized tracking system that helps organize my progress in reading.
The target audience for this program is people who read lots of novels or wants to start reading novels.
